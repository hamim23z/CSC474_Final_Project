In short, the goal of this project is to study some data set, research related problems/questions, and develop an interactive visualization that will solve this problem. The most likely 
solution to this is to include an interactive dashboard along with a set of stories that will make this dashboard make sense.

When choosing the project, there should be 4 main criteria to meet:
- Novelty: Has this been done before?
- Impact: What impact could/would this project have on the world?
- Triviality: Will this project involve significant measurable work?
- Scope: Is it realistic to expect this project can be completed in the given time?

Now when choosing the dataset, there is also a set of criteria to meet:
- Multivariate relationships (more then 6 attributes)
- Med-Large (more than 5000 data points)
- Real Data
- Avoid Generic Climate Data
- Make sure Data Actually Available
- Avoid extensive processing or heavy ML

What to submit?:
- Proposal first. Should have names of members and then an abstract that's 1-2 paragraphs. This should be done first.
- Then work on the PDF refort, 5 pages is fine. Should have figures, references, cover, citations.
- Slides for presentation.
- GitHub repo link.
